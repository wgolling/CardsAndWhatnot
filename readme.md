# Cards And Whatnot

Basic cards game; my first largish coding project and first Java project.  Currently runs Hearts, but I plan to implement Uno as well.  Its current state is "working" but there is a lot left to do in terms of clean-up, refactoring, and user experience.  Only has a Console interface at this point, for which I developed my own "graphics engine".

## Getting Started

Download CardsAndWhatnot.jar from the /dist/ folder and run the console command ' java -jar "CardsAndWhatnot.jar" '.

### Prerequisites

Needs I think at least Java 8.
